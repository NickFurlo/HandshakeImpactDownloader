Handshake Impact Downloader
	This script will download csv files from handshakes insight data, survey results, and event results in bulk. It imports
	the links to the pages through a CSV file and then downloads the data from those links and puts them in a designated folder.
	It can also transfer those files to another location such as a network drive. You can set it to delete files older than
	a user specified amount of time.

Getting Started
	Run the script to create the config file. Edit the config file to include the path of the download link CSV. Run the script again and the files will download automatically.
